                                        <br> The night you left with a kiss so kind<br> Only a scent of beauty left
                                        behind
                                        <br></p>

                                    <p>Ah dear friend I remember the night<br> The moon and the dreams we shared<br>
                                        Your trembling paw in my hand<br> Dreaming of that northern land<br>
                                        Touching me with a kiss of a beast<br></p>

                                    <p>I know my dreams are made of you<br> Of you and only for you<br> Your ocean
                                        pulls me under<br> Your voice tears me asunder<br> Love me before the last

                                        world would be<br> If no love did flow in thee<br> But as my heart is
                                        occupied<br> Your love for me now has to die<br> Forgive me I need more
                                        than you can offer me<br></p>

                                    <p>Didn’t you read the tale<br> Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?<br>
                                        Don’t you know this tale<br> In which all I ever wanted<br> I’ll never
                                        have<br> For who could ever learn to love a beast?<br></p>

                                <br> We’re walking in the air<br> We’re floating in the midnight sky<br> And
                                everyone who sees us greets us as we fly<br>

                                <p>&ldquo;I was born amidst the purple waterfalls. <br> I was weak, yet not
                                    unblessed.
                                    <br> Dead to the world. Alive for the journey. <br> One night I dreamt a white
                                    rose withering, <br> a newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness.
                                    <br> I dreamt all my future. Relived my past. <br> A witnessed the beauty of the
                                    beast&rdquo; </p>

                                <p>Where have all the feelings gone? <br> Why has all the laughter ceased? </p>

                                <p>Why am I loved only when I&rsquo;m gone? <br> Gone back in time to bless the
                                    child
                                    <br> Think of me long enough to make a memory <br> Come bless the child one more
                                    time </p>

                                <p>How can I ever feel again? <br> Given the chance would I return? </p>

                                <p>I&rsquo;ve never felt so alone in my life <br> As I drank from a cup which was
                                    counting my time <br> There&rsquo;s a poison drop in this cup of Man <br> To
                                    drink it is to follow the left hand path </p>

                                <p>&ldquo;Where have all the feelings gone? <br> Why is the deadliest sin - to love
                                    as I loved you? <br> Now unblessed, homesick in time, <br> soon to be freed from
                                    care, from human pain. <br> My tale is the most bitter
                                    truth:
                                    <br> Time pays us but with earth &amp; dust, and a dark, silent grave. <br>
                                    Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron, <br> hope is only
                                    an illusion &amp; Ocean Soul&rsquo;s nothing but a name&hellip;

                                    poisons my lungs <br> An old oak sheltering me from the blue <br> Sun bathing on
                                    its dead frozen leaves </p>

                                <p>A catnap in the ghost town of my heart <br> She dreams of storytime and the river

                                <p><strong>4. Love</strong> </p>

                                <p>I see a slow, simple youngster by a busy street, with a begging bowl in his
                                    shaking hand. <br> Trying to smile but hurting infinitely. Nobody notices. <br>
                                    I do, but walk by. </p>

                                <p>An old man gets naked and kisses a model-doll in his attic. <br> It&rsquo;s
                                    half-light and he&rsquo;s in tears. <br> When he finally comes his eyes are
                                    cascading. </p>

                                <p>I see a beaten dog in a pungent alley. He tries to bite me. <br> All pride has
                                    left his wild drooling eyes. <br> I wish I had my leg to spare. </p>

                                <p>A mother visits her son, smiles to him through the bars. <br> She&rsquo;s never
                                    loved him more. </p>

                                <p>An obese girl enters an elevator with me. <br> All dressed up fancy, a green
                                    butterfly on her neck. <br> Terribly sweet perfume deafens me. <br> She&rsquo;s
                                    going to dinner alone. <br> That makes her even more beautiful.
                                </p>

                                <p>I see a model&rsquo;s face on a brick wall. <br> A statue of porcelain perfection
                                    beside a violent city kill. <br> A city that worships flesh. </p>

                                <p>The 1st thing I ever heard was a wandering man telling his story <br> It was you,
                                    the grass under my bare feet <br> The campfire in the dead of the night <br> The
                                    heavenly black of sky and sea </p>

                                <p>It was us <br> Roaming the rainy roads, combing the gilded beaches <br> Waking up
                                    to a new gallery of wonders every morn <br> Bathing in places no-one&rsquo;s
                                    seen before <br> Shipwrecked on some matt-painted island
                                    <br> Clad in nothing but the surf - beauty&rsquo;s finest robe </p>

                                <p>Beyond all mortality we are, swinging in the breath of nature <br> In early air
                                    of the dawn of life <br> A sight to silence the heavens </p>

                                <p>I want to travel where life travels, following its permanent lead <br> Where the
                                    air tastes like snow music <br> Where grass smells like fresh-born Eden <br> I
                                    would pass no man, no stranger, no tragedy or rapture
                                    <br> I would bathe in a world of sensation <br> Love, Goodness, and Simplicity
                                    <br> ( While violated and imprisoned by technology ) </p>

                                <p>The thought of my family&rsquo;s graves was the only moment I used to experience
                                    true love <br> That love remains infinite, as I&rsquo;ll never be the man my
                                    father is </p>

                                <p>How can you &ldquo;just be yourself&rdquo; when you don&rsquo;t know who you are?
                                    <br> Stop saying &ldquo;I know how you feel&rdquo; <br> How could anyone know
                                    how another feels? </p>

                                <p>Who am I to judge a priest, beggar, whore, politician, wrongdoer? <br> I am, you
                                    are, all of them already </p>
